# Project: RFID Vehicle Management System with STM32 and SD Card Integration

## Objective
This project aims to develop a RFID Vehicle Management System using an STM32 microcontroller and an SD card for data storage. The system will utilize RFID tags attached to vehicles for identification and manage their entry and exit from a designated area.
